      Electronic engineering (also called electronics and communications
      engineering) is an electrical engineering discipline which utilizes
      nonlinear and active electrical components (such as semiconductor devices,
      especially transistors, diodes and integrated circuits) to design
      electronic circuits, devices, VLSI devices and their systems. The
      discipline typically also designs passive electrical components, usually
      based on printed circuit boards. Electronics is a subfield within the
      wider electrical engineering academic subject but denotes a broad
      engineering field that covers subfields such as analog electronics,
      digital electronics, consumer electronics, embedded systems and power
      electronics. Electronics engineering deals with implementation of
      applications, principles and algorithms developed within many related
      fields, for example solid-state physics, radio engineering,
      telecommunications, control systems, signal processing, systems
      engineering, computer engineering, instrumentation engineering, electric
      power control, robotics, and many others
